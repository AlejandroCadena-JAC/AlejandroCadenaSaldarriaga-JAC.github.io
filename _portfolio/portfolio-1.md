# Functionality

This project consists of a planner of the rem stations available in December 2022.
The goal is to provide the user with an estimated arrival time and duration of their trip.
The user selects the stations they are coming from and going to along with their departure time.
The button prints out the stations the user will be passing by along with the estimated arrival time for each station.
The station info button provides a fun fact about the station the user selected.
# My Contribution

I actually did write this entire code myself while using the notes I was provided in class.
The creation of this project came to fruition due to this being the project that was proposed to be the final project of my web programming 1 class
I am especially proud of it since I found that it's functionality was fully there and I spent a lot of time on the front end coding of the project to make it look very pleasing.
