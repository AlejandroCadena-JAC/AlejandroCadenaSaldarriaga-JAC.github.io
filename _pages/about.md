I am a 20 year old student at John Abbott College currently in the process of obtaining my computer science degree.

The main focus of my programming journey has been to become a better user interface and user experience designer.

Why?, you may ask? I found that I really liked to design and provide a visual for clients and myself rather than being in front of a console all day.

The artistic and aesthetic side of programming really intrigued me. So much so that I spent time learning JavaScript, CSS, HTML and the basics of front end design both for my own knowledge and for the ability to be able to provide good products in the future.
I would love to find myself in the UX/UI space in the near future, I find that it is the style of job that suits me perfectly.

# Hobbies and non professional life

Despite thourougly enjoying programming in most of it facets, I do also like to do other activities in my off time.

- Powerlifting
- Video Editing
- Making Videos
- Playing Video Games

This short list is just a small amount of things that I like to do in my off time, they have also helped me become a better programmer at the same time.
During these I tend to find myself debugging my code without thinking since they are activities that help clear the brain fog you get during long coding sessions.
