# Who I am and why I study Computer Science

I am a 20 year old student at John Abbott College currently in the process of obtaining my computer science degree.

The main focus of my programming journey has been to become a better user interface and user experience designer.

Why?, you may ask? I found that I really liked to design and provide a visual for clients and myself rather than being in front of a console all day.

The artistic and aesthetic side of programming really intrigued me. So much so that I spent time learning JavaScript, CSS, HTML and the basics of front end design both for my own knowledge and for the ability to be abel to provide godd products in the future.
